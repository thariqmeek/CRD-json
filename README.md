# CRD-json

## Freshworks â€“ Backend Assignment

Build a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete) operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop. The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work with the data store.

` ` `
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
` ` `


* Json data are saved in seperate *TEXT* file in *personOut.json* in location *d:\\json\\personsOut.json*.

## ![](freshworks/json.jpg)

* it will reliably create itself in a reasonable location on the laptop *d:\\json\\personsOut.json*.  

### Inserting data and STORING IT IN A LOCAL SYSTEM FILE *personsOut.json*
